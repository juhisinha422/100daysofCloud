	•	Git Merge = combine branches
	•	Git Rebase = clean linear history
	•	Git Reset = move HEAD back
	•	Soft Reset = commits removed, changes staged
	•	Mixed Reset = commits removed, changes unstaged
	•	Hard Reset = commits + changes deleted
	•	Git Revert = safe undo with new commit
	•	Git Squash = many commits → one
	•	Git Stash = temporary save
	•	Git Cherry-Pick = copy specific commit
	•	Git Tag = mark release/version



“Merge joins, Rebase realigns, Reset goes back, Revert undoes safely, Soft saves stage, Mixed keeps files, Hard wipes all, Squash makes one, Stash hides work, Cherry-pick picks one, Tag marks release.”
