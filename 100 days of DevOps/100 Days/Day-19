100 Days of DevOps — Day 19 (19/100)
=================

1️⃣ What is Peer Discovery in Kubernetes?

Peer discovery is the mechanism by which pods automatically find and communicate with each other inside the cluster.

2️⃣ What is a Headless Service?

A headless service (clusterIP: None) bypasses load-balancing and returns the IPs of individual pods via DNS.

3️⃣ What is a StatefulSet?

A StatefulSet is used for stateful applications and gives each pod a stable name, stable identity, and persistent storage.

4️⃣ What is a Deployment?

A Deployment is used for stateless applications and manages replica sets, scaling, rolling updates, and rollbacks.

5️⃣ What is K9s in Kubernetes?

K9s is a terminal-based UI tool that allows you to view and manage Kubernetes resources interactively.

6️⃣ What is a CronJob?

A CronJob allows you to run Jobs on a fixed schedule, similar to Linux cron timing.

7️⃣ What is a Job in Kubernetes?

A Job runs a task until completion, ensuring the workload succeeds at least once.

8️⃣ What is a Scheduler in Kubernetes?

The Scheduler decides which node should run each pod based on resource requirements and constraints.

9️⃣ What is the difference between Deployment and StatefulSet?

Deployments handle stateless apps with identical pods; StatefulSets handle stateful apps with unique pod identities and storage.

🔟 What is a ReplicaSet?

A ReplicaSet ensures a defined number of identical pod replicas are always running.

===============

1. Peer discovery = pods automatically finding each other.
 
2. Headless service = service without ClusterIP that exposes pod IPs.
 
3. StatefulSet = stable identity + stable storage for each pod.
 
4. Deployment = best for stateless apps.
 
5. K9s = terminal UI for fast Kubernetes management.
 
6. CronJob = scheduled job execution.
 
7. Job = run-to-completion workload.
 
8. Scheduler = decides which node runs a pod.
 
9. Deployment vs StatefulSet = stateless vs stateful.
 
10. ReplicaSet = keeps required pod replicas running.
