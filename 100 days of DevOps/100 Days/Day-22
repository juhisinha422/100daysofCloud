100 Days of DevOps — Day 22 


========
1️⃣ What is the difference between Ingress and Ingress Controller?
Ingress defines rules for routing external traffic into Kubernetes.
 Ingress Controller is the actual engine (NGINX/Traefik) that enforces those rules.
2️⃣ Linux authentication failed — where do you check?
Check logs in /var/log/auth.log (Ubuntu) or /var/log/secure (RHEL/CentOS).
 They show failed attempts, wrong passwords, and PAM issues.

4️⃣ What are Labels, Selectors & Annotations? (Clear Explanation)
Labels: Key-value tags used to identify Pods, Nodes, Deployments, etc.
 Selectors: Used by Services/Deployments to match objects using labels.
 Annotations: Store extra metadata; not used for filtering or scheduling.
Where used:

Pods → labels for Service/Deployment matching
Nodes → labels for scheduling (NodeSelector/NodeAffinity)
Containers → do not have labels; labels belong to Pod metadata

5️⃣ What is OIDC?
OIDC = OpenID Connect, an identity layer built on OAuth2.
 Used for secure authentication like Kubernetes IRSA for AWS IAM roles.

6️⃣ What is a Service Account in Kubernetes?
A Service Account provides an identity for Pods to access the API server.
 It avoids putting user passwords or tokens inside containers.

7️⃣ Difference between su and su -
su switches user but keeps the current environment.
 su - gives a full login shell with that user’s profile and PATH.

8️⃣ What is sudo password and what is PATH?
sudo password = your own user password, not root’s.
 PATH = list of directories where Linux looks for executable commands.

9️⃣ Difference between sudo and su?
sudo runs a single command with elevated privileges.
 su switches to the root user entirely and needs the root password.

🔟 Difference between Labels and Selectors (use case)?
Labels tag objects like Pods (app=frontend).
 Selectors choose objects based on labels (example: Service selects Pods).

=============

Ingress defines rules; Ingress Controller enforces them.

Check /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure for login failures.

Prune removes 30-day-old and dangling Docker images.

Labels identify, selectors match, annotations describe.

OIDC = identity layer for secure authentication.

Service Accounts = identities for Pods to access the API.

su keeps current environment; su - loads full login shell.

sudo uses your user password; PATH decides command locations.

sudo = run one command as root; su = switch to root user.

Labels tag objects; selectors find and match those labels.
