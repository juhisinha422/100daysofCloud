100 Days of DevOps — Day 31

1.What is swap used for?
 👉 Swap extends memory using disk when RAM is full.

2. What is mounting in Linux?
 👉 Mounting attaches a filesystem to a directory.

3. How do you check inode usage?
 👉 Use df -i to view inode utilization.

4. What is an inode in Linux?
 👉 Stores file metadata like permissions, owner, size — not filename or data.

5. Temporary vs permanent mount?
 👉 Temporary mounts disappear after reboot; permanent mounts persist via /etc/fstab.


6. What is /etc/fstab used for?
 👉 Defines filesystems that auto-mount at boot.

7. Block storage vs file storage?
 👉 Block = raw disk; File = shared filesystem.

8. What happens when inode usage reaches 100%?
 👉 No new files can be created, even if disk space is free.

9. What is LVM?
 👉 Logical Volume Manager enables resizing volumes without downtime.

10. How do you extend disk space without downtime?
 👉 Extend the LVM logical volume and resize the filesystem online.
 

✨ Memory Shortcut
Swap = Disk extends RAM
Mount = Attach filesystem
Check inode = df -i
Temp mount = Lost after reboot
/etc/fstab = Auto-mount
Block = Raw, File = Shared
Inode full = No new files
LVM = Resize without downtime
Extend disk = LVM + resize fs
Inode = Metadata only
