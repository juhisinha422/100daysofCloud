1️⃣ How do you configure ports in Kubernetes?

You configure ports using containerPort, hostPort, and nodePort inside Pod or Service YAML.
containerPort is internal to the container, while nodePort exposes externally through the cluster node.

⸻

2️⃣ How can you manage ports in Kubernetes?

Ports are managed through Services like ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
NetworkPolicies control traffic rules, and Ingress manages HTTP/HTTPS routing.

⸻

3️⃣ When a container runs as a non-root user, how do you manage ports?

Non-root containers cannot bind to ports <1024, so you run apps on high ports like 8080/3000.
Use Kubernetes Service to expose the high port to users without needing root privileges.

⸻

4️⃣ What are the pillars of Kubernetes storage & networking?

Pillars include Compute (Pods), Networking (Services/Ingress), Storage (PV/PVC), and Configuration (ConfigMaps/Secrets).
They ensure apps run portably, scalable, and with predictable networking & data behavior.

⸻

5️⃣ What is EBS? Where & why do we use it?

Answer (2 lines):
AWS EBS is a block storage device attached to EC2/K8 worker nodes.
Used for single-node, low-latency storage like databases or applications needing durable block volumes.

⸻

6️⃣ What is EFS? Where & why do we use it?

AWS EFS is a scalable NFS shared file system accessible by multiple nodes.
Used when Pods need shared storage, multi-AZ access, or auto-scaling file storage.

⸻

7️⃣ What is static vs dynamic provisioning in Kubernetes storage?

Static provisioning means admin pre-creates PVs manually.
Dynamic provisioning automatically creates storage using StorageClass when PVC is requested.

⸻

8️⃣ What is PVC & PV in Kubernetes (wrap object)?

PV (PersistentVolume) is actual storage; PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is the request for storage.
PVC acts like a “wrap object” that binds to the right PV based on size & access mode.

⸻

9️⃣ How does Kubernetes ensure storage persists when pods restart?

Pods use PVCs attached to PVs, so data remains even if pods crash or recreate.
Storage lifecycle is independent of the Pod lifecycle.

⸻

🔟 What storage types are ephemeral vs persistent in Kubernetes?


emptyDir, configMap, and secret volumes are ephemeral—deleted with the Pod.
PV/PVC, EBS, EFS, Ceph, NFS volumes are persistent across Pod restarts.


=========


1.	Port Configuration = containerPort /  hostPort / nodePort basics.
	
2.	Port Management = Services + Ingress routing.
	
3.	Non-Root Ports = use high ports (8080) safely.
	
4.	Storage Pillars = Compute, Network, Storage foundation.
	
5.	EBS = single-node block storage durability.
	
6.	EFS = multi-node shared storage scalability.   
	
7.	Static Provisioning = manually created PV resources.
	
8.	Dynamic Provisioning = automatic PV via StorageClass.
	
9.	PV & PVC = storage + claim binding mechanism.
	
10.	Ephemeral vs Persistent = temporary vs durable data.
