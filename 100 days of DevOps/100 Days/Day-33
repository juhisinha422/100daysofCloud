100 Days of DevOps — Day 33


1. Difference between Resource and Data Source in Terraform

A resource is used to create, update, and delete infrastructure, 
while a data source is used only to fetch information about existing infrastructure without managing or modifying it.

2. What are Terraform state files?

Terraform state files (terraform.tfstate) store information about the infrastructure Terraform manages, 
including resource IDs and current configuration, allowing Terraform to track changes.

3. What are the types of state backends?

Terraform state backends are mainly of two types:
Local backend – stores the state file on the local system
Remote backend – stores the state file remotely (S3, Azure Blob, GCS, Terraform Cloud)

4. What is state locking?

State locking prevents multiple users from applying changes to the same state file at the same time, avoiding conflicts and infrastructure corruption.

5. How do you inspect Terraform state?

Terraform state can be inspected using commands like:
terraform state list
terraform state show <resource>
terraform show

6. What are variables in Terraform?

Variables in Terraform allow values to be reused and customized, making configurations flexible, reusable, and easier to manage across environments.

7. What are the types of variables in Terraform?

Terraform supports:
Input variables
Output variables
Local variables

8. How do you pass variables in Terraform?

Variables can be passed using:
terraform.tfvars file
Command-line flags (-var)
Environment variables
Default values in variable definitions

9. What is output in Terraform?

Outputs are used to display important information after infrastructure creation, such as IP addresses, resource IDs, or endpoints, and can also be shared between modules.

10. What is terraform.tfvars?

terraform.tfvars is a file that automatically loads variable values into Terraform without requiring command-line input.

================================

Resources create infrastructure, data sources read existing infrastructure, state tracks it, backends store it, variables customize it, and outputs expose results.


 idempotent behavior, and simple HCL syntax, Terraform makes infrastructure automation reliable and scalable.
Today’s focus:
• Resources vs Data Sources
• Terraform state and backends
• State locking and inspection
• Variables, tfvars, and outputs
