⭐ Tight Coupling vs Loose Coupling (Simple Analogy)

“Tight coupling is like French fries stuck together 🍟— one breaks, everything breaks.
Loose coupling is like separate fries — independent, flexible, easy to manage!
Keep your code like good fries: loosely coupled 😎✨

🔒 Tight Coupling

Two components depend on each other too much.
If one breaks, the other breaks too.

🍟 Analogy:
Imagine French fries stuck together while frying.
If you pull one fry, the other also comes —
they cannot work independently.

👉 In software, tightly-coupled code is hard to change, hard to test, and easy to break.

⸻

🔓 Loose Coupling

Two components work independently and only connect when needed.

🍟 Analogy:
Think of separate French fries in a packet.
Each fry is independent.
If one fry breaks, the others are fine.

👉 In software, loosely-coupled code is flexible, easy to test, and easy to modify.

💡 Quick Summary

🔒 Tight Coupling = Fries stuck together → Hard to separate
🔓 Loose Coupling = Each fry separate → Easy to manage
