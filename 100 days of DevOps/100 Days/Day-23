100 Days of DevOps  — Day 23 (23/100) 


1️⃣ What is a Module in Terraform?

A module is a reusable collection of Terraform resources used to standardize and simplify infrastructure code.

⸻

2️⃣ What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated virtual network in AWS where we launch resources.

⸻

3️⃣ What is VPC Peering?

VPC Peering allows private communication between two VPCs using private IPs.

⸻

4️⃣ What is a Subnet?

A subnet is a range of IP addresses inside a VPC used to group resources.

⸻

5️⃣ What is a Public Subnet?

A public subnet has a route to an Internet Gateway, allowing internet access.

⸻

6️⃣ What is a Private Subnet?

A private subnet does not have direct internet access and is usually used for databases or backend services.

⸻

7️⃣ Where do we use depends_on in Terraform?

depends_on is used when Terraform cannot automatically detect resource dependencies.

⸻

8️⃣ Where do we use slice() in Terraform?

slice() is used to select a subset of elements from a list, commonly for AZ or subnet selection.

⸻

9️⃣ What is Association in Terraform?

Association links resources together, such as route table association with subnets.

⸻

🔟 Why are Modules important in Terraform?

Modules improve reusability, consistency, and maintainability of infrastructure code.



===========


Module = reusable set of Terraform resources

VPC = logically isolated virtual network in AWS.

VPC Peering = private connectivity between two VPCs.

Subnet = smaller IP range inside a VPC.

Public Subnet = subnet with internet gateway access.

Private Subnet = subnet without direct internet access.

depends_on = enforces resource creation order.

slice() = extracts a portion of a list.

Association = linking one resource to another.

Route Table Association = connects subnet to routing rules.
