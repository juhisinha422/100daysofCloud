100 Days of DevOps  — Day 16 (16/100)

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
🔥 Stay consistent 



1️⃣ What is Terraform State (terraform.tfstate)?

Terraform state stores the current real-world infrastructure details so Terraform understands what already exists and what needs to change.

⸻

2️⃣ What is Terraform .tf File?

.tf files contain the desired infrastructure configuration written in HCL — including resources, providers, variables, and modules.

⸻

3️⃣ What is the Difference Between Encoded and Encrypted?
	•	Encoding → Converts data into a readable/transferable format (Base64).
	•	Encryption → Secures data using keys so only authorized users can decrypt it.

⸻

4️⃣ What is a Service in Kubernetes & Its Types?

A Service gives a stable network endpoint to access Pods.
Types:
	•	ClusterIP – Internal access
	•	NodePort – Exposes on node IP:port
	•	LoadBalancer – External access via cloud LB

⸻

5️⃣ What Are Replicas in Kubernetes?

Replicas define how many identical Pod copies must run to ensure availability and load distribution.

⸻

6️⃣ What Is a Deployment in Kubernetes?

Deployment manages the desired state of Pods, handling rollouts, rollbacks, and scaling.

⸻

7️⃣ What Is a Rolling Update?

A rolling update replaces old Pods with new ones gradually, ensuring zero-downtime deployment.

⸻

8️⃣ Difference Between Variables and Locals in Terraform
	•	Variables → External inputs (user/environment).
	•	Locals → Internal computed values for clean code.

⸻

9️⃣ What Is a Dynamic Block / Loop in Terraform?

Dynamic blocks create repeated nested blocks using loops — used for tags, security group rules, IAM policies, etc.

⸻

🔟 What Are Provisioners in Terraform?

Provisioners execute commands or scripts (local-exec/remote-exec) on resources after creation. Used only when no native Terraform option exists.
==============


1.	Terraform state = Terraform’s memory of real resources.

2.	.tf file = Blueprint of desired infrastructure.

3.	Encoding = format change; Encryption = secure protection.
	
4.	Service = stable networking with ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.
	
5.	Replicas = number of Pod copies.
	
6.	Deployment = controller that manages Pods.
	
7.	Rolling update = zero-downtime updates.
	

8.	Variables = inputs; Locals = internal logic.
	
9.	Dynamic block = loop inside resource for repeated blocks.
	
10.	Provisioners = run commands on        resources.
