100 Days of DevOps — Day 24 (24/100)



1️⃣ What is Blue-Green Deployment?

Blue-Green deployment is a release strategy where two environments exist: Blue (current live) and Green (new version).
Traffic is switched from Blue to Green after successful testing.
This approach enables zero-downtime deployments and quick rollback.

⸻

2️⃣ What is Xero Time?

Xero Time (formerly WorkflowMax Time) is a time-tracking tool integrated with Xero accounting.
It helps teams log work hours for billing, payroll, and reporting.
Commonly used by service-based and project-driven organizations.

⸻

3️⃣ Types of Deployment Used with Xero Time

Xero Time typically supports Rolling Deployment for gradual updates.
Blue-Green deployment is used to avoid service disruption.
Canary deployment is used to test features with limited users first.

⸻

4️⃣ What is a Cordon Node in Kubernetes?

Cordon marks a node as unschedulable.
New pods will not be placed on the node, but existing pods continue running.
It is mainly used during maintenance or upgrades.

⸻

5️⃣ What Does “Drain the Blue” Mean?

Draining the Blue environment means gracefully stopping traffic and workloads.
Pods are safely evicted and traffic is redirected to Green.
This ensures no downtime during Blue-Green switch.

⸻

6️⃣ What is AWS SSM (Systems Manager)?

AWS SSM is a management service for EC2 and on-prem servers.
It allows remote command execution, patching, and configuration.
No SSH access is needed, which improves security and automation.

⸻

7️⃣ What is a Data Source in Terraform?

A Terraform data source is used to fetch existing infrastructure data.
It does not create resources but reads information like AMI IDs or VPCs.
Helpful when integrating existing cloud resources.

⸻

8️⃣ Difference Between Blue-Green and Rolling Deployment

Blue-Green switches traffic all at once between environments.
Rolling deployment updates instances one by one.
Blue-Green allows instant rollback, while rolling reduces resource usage.

⸻

9️⃣ Why is Draining Important Before Node Maintenance?

Draining ensures pods are safely moved to other nodes.
It prevents application downtime during upgrades.
Used with cordon to maintain cluster stability.

⸻
🔟 Where is AWS SSM Commonly Used in DevOps?

SSM is used for automation, patch management, and runbooks.
It replaces manual SSH operations.
Widely used in secure, large-scale infrastructure management
***************

Blue-Green Deployment = zero-downtime traffic switch.

Xero Time = time tracking tool.

Xero Time Deployment Types = rolling, blue-green, canary.

Cordon Node = prevents new pod scheduling.

Drain the Blue = safely removes running workloads.

AWS SSM = manage servers without SSH.

Data Source = reads existing infrastructure.

Blue-Green vs Rolling = instant switch vs gradual update.

Drain Node = moves pods safely.

AWS SSM Use Case = automation and patching.
