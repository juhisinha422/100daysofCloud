100 Days of DevOps — Day 30(30/100)

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
🔥 Stay consistent

1.What is the Golden Image concept?
 A tested, versioned image used consistently across all environments.

2.How is capacity decided in real projects?
 Capacity is chosen based on workload metrics, not guesswork.

3.What is auto-scaling?
 Auto-scaling automatically adds or removes instances based on demand.

4.What is Authentication?
 Authentication verifies who the user or service is.

5.What is Authorization?
 Authorization defines what actions an authenticated identity can perform.

6.What are Firewalls and Security Groups?
 They control allowed and blocked network traffic at different levels.

7.What is Secrets Management?
 Secure storage and rotation of credentials without hardcoding.

8.Why is Monitoring and Logging important?
 They provide visibility into system health and failures.

9.What is Immutability in DevOps?
 Servers are replaced, not modified manually after creation.

10.What is the Shared Responsibility Model?
 Cloud provider manages infrastructure, DevOps manages OS, apps, and data.

AMI = Server template
 Golden Image = Standardized tested image
 Immutability = Replace not modify
Capacity Planning = Metrics based sizing
 Auto Scaling = Automatic instance adjustment
 Load Balancer = Traffic distributor
Authentication = Who you are
 Authorization = What you can do
Firewall = Network gatekeeper
 Security Group = Resource-level firewall
Secrets Management = Secure credentials storage
 Networking = Communication backbone
Monitoring = System health visibility
 Logging = Event history
Environment Separation = Dev / Test / Stage / Prod
 Configuration Management = Externalized settings
Change Management = Tracked and reversible changes
 Cost Awareness = Resource optimization
Source of Truth = Version control
 Artifact = Build once output
Deployment Strategy = Safe release method
 Stateless = No local data
 Stateful = Data dependent
Backup = Data protection
 Disaster Recovery = System restoration
Access Lifecycle = Join, change, revoke
 Shared Responsibility = Provider infra, customer OS & data
Reliability = Stable system behavior
 Error Budget = Acceptable failure limit
