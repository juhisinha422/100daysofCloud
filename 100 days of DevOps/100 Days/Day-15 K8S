100 Days of DevOps  — Day 15 (15/100)

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
🔥 Stay consistent 


1️⃣ What is Kubernetes (K8s)?
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform used to run, scale, and manage applications.
It automates deployments, networking, load balancing, and health monitoring.

2️⃣ What is a Pod?
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
It runs one or more containers with shared network and storage.

3️⃣ What is a Spec in Kubernetes?
spec is the part of a YAML file that defines the desired state of an object.
It includes containers, images, volumes, ports, replicas, and resource limits.

4️⃣ What are Labels in Kubernetes?
Labels are key-value pairs used for grouping, filtering, and selecting Kubernetes objects.
Services and Deployments use labels to find the right Pods.

5️⃣ What are Annotations in Kubernetes?
Annotations store non-searchable metadata about an object.
They are used for documentation, automation tools, and tracking information.

6️⃣ What is a Kubernetes Service?
A Service exposes Pods using a stable IP or DNS to allow communication.
Types include ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName, and Headless.

7️⃣ What is Resource Utilization?
Resource utilization means how much CPU, Memory, and storage a Pod/container consumes.
You manage it using resource limits, requests, HPA, and autoscaling.

8️⃣ What is Terraform?
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool used to build, manage, and automate cloud resources.
It uses configuration files to create consistent and repeatable infrastructure.

9️⃣ What is terraform.tfstate?
terraform.tfstate stores Terraform’s real-time record of deployed resources.
It helps Terraform understand what exists and what needs to be updated.

🔟 What is Access Control in Kubernetes?
Kubernetes access is managed using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).
In cloud platforms like AWS, IAM roles work together with RBAC for secure access.
===============


1️⃣ Kubernetes = Container Orchestration
Manages Pods, scaling, networking.

2️⃣ Pod = Smallest Unit
Runs one or more containers.

3️⃣ Spec = Desired State
Tells Kubernetes what to create.

4️⃣ Labels = Filters
Used for selection & grouping.

5️⃣ Annotations = Extra Info
Metadata not used for selection.

6️⃣ K8s Resources = Objects
Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.

7️⃣ Service = Stable Access
ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer.

8️⃣ Resource Utilization = CPU/MEM
Managed using limits, requests, autoscaling.

9️⃣ Terraform.tfstate = Actual State
Terraform checks real vs desired infra.

🔟 AWS Access in K8s = IAM + RBAC
AWS controls access using IAM; Kubernetes uses RBAC.
