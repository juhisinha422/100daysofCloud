🚀 Day 9/100 – Ansible Keys & Authentication 🔐 (Round 4 Tough Set)

Topic: Real-time SSH & Vault Key Troubleshooting

⸻

🔹 1️⃣ You see this error:
Failed to connect to the host via ssh: Permission denied (publickey)
What’s the most likely reason?
A) Wrong Ansible version
B) SSH key not copied to managed node
C) Inventory path error
D) Syntax issue in playbook

⸻

🔹 2️⃣ You already have passwordless SSH setup, but Ansible still asks for a password. Why?
A) ansible_user variable missing
B) ansible_ssh_private_key_file misconfigured
C) Wrong remote user in playbook
D) All of the above

⸻

🔹 3️⃣ Which command generates SSH key pairs for Ansible user?
A) ansible-keygen
B) ssh-keygen
C) ansible-vault create key
D) ansible-inventory --gen-key

⸻

🔹 4️⃣ What’s the role of Vault ID in Ansible?
A) Identifies playbook version
B) Links vault secrets to a specific key
C) Used for host authentication
D) Encrypts YAML structure

⸻

🔹 5️⃣ You get this error:
ERROR! Attempting to decrypt but no vault secrets found.
How do you fix it?
A) Delete vault file
B) Use --ask-vault-pass or --vault-password-file
C) Use --become
D) Add vars_files in playbook

⸻

🔹 6️⃣ Which file commonly stores SSH identity configuration by default?

B) ~/.ssh/config
C) /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
D) ~/.ansible/keyfile

⸻

A) ansible-playbook -vvv
B) ansible-config dump
C) ansible-inventory --list
D) ansible-vault view

⸻

🔹 8️⃣ You want to bypass vault encryption temporarily. What option helps?
A) --ignore-vault
B) --skip-vault
C) --ask-vault-pass
D) No option exists (must decrypt first)

⸻

🔹 9️⃣ How should SSH private keys be stored in production pipelines?
A) Inside Git repo
B) Encrypted using Vault or secret manager
C) Hard-coded in playbooks
D) In /tmp for temporary access

⸻

🔹 🔟 You suspect a key mismatch on a managed node. How to verify?
A) ssh-keyscan <host>
B) ansible --check-key <host>
C) ansible-keyverify
D) cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa

⸻
