100 Days of DevOps — Day 29(29/100)

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
🔥 Stay consistent

1.What is SDLC?
 SDLC is the structured flow from requirements to maintenance for building software.
2.Where does DevOps fit in SDLC?
 DevOps connects development and operations through continuous automation and feedback.
3.How is DevOps different from Waterfall?
 Waterfall is sequential, while DevOps enables continuous build, test, and deploy.
4.Why does DevOps focus on what users never see?
 Because reliability, automation, and monitoring prevent user-facing issues.
5.What is On-Prem infrastructure?
 On-prem means owning and managing servers, networks, and data centers yourself.
6.What is Cloud infrastructure?
 Cloud provides on-demand infrastructure managed by a provider and paid per use.
7.Why is cloud better for DevOps?
 Cloud enables fast scaling, automation, and infrastructure as code.
8.What is an Operating System?
 OS manages hardware resources and provides a platform for applications.
9.What is a Kernel?
 Kernel is the core of the OS that directly communicates with hardware.
10.What is an AMI or Machine Image?
 An image is a reusable template containing OS and preconfigured software.

SDLC = Requirements → Design → Code → Test → Deploy → Maintain
 Waterfall = Sequential flow
 Agile = Iterative delivery
 DevOps = Continuous build, test, deploy, monitor
 Automation = Primary DevOps responsibility
On-Prem = Own hardware and data center
 Cloud = Rent infrastructure on demand
 Scalability = Scale up or down quickly
 Pay-as-you-go = Pay only for usage
Operating System = Resource manager
 Kernel = Hardware communicator
