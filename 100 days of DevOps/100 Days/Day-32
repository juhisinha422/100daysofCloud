100 Days of DevOps — Day 32

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
 🔥 Stay consistent


1. What is Terraform and why is it used in DevOps?

Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
 tool used to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. 
In DevOps, it is used to automate infrastructure provisioning and management across cloud and on-prem environments.

2. What language does Terraform use?

Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), a declarative language designed to define infrastructure clearly and human-readably.

3. What is the difference between Terraform and CloudFormation?

Terraform is cloud-agnostic and supports multiple providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.),
 while CloudFormation is AWS-specific and works only within the AWS ecosystem.

4. What are the main Terraform commands or workflow?

The main Terraform workflow includes:
terraform init – initializes the working directory
terraform plan – shows execution plan
terraform apply – creates or updates infrastructure
terraform destroy – deletes infrastructure

5. Explain desired state vs actual state.

The desired state is what you define in Terraform configuration files, while the actual state is the real infrastructure running in the environment. 
Terraform compares both and makes changes to match the desired state.

6. What does idempotent mean in Terraform?

Idempotency means running the same Terraform code multiple times will not change the infrastructure if it already matches the desired state.

7. What are providers in Terraform?

Providers are plugins that allow Terraform to communicate with cloud platforms, SaaS tools, and APIs. 
They define what resources and data sources Terraform can manage.

8. How do you lock a provider version?

Provider versions can be locked using the required_providers block to ensure consistent and predictable deployments.

9. What are resources in Terraform?
Resources represent infrastructure components such as EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, load balancers, and databases that Terraform creates and manages.

10. What are data sources in Terraform?

Data sources allow Terraform to fetch existing information from providers (like AMI IDs or VPC details). 
They are read-only and do not create resources.

=====================
Terraform is a cloud, tool using HCL that automates infrastructure through providers, resources, data sources, and an idempotent workflow of init, plan, apply, and destroy.


Terraform makes infrastructure predictable, repeatable, and scalable using Infrastructure as Code.
=======

• Declarative HCL language
• Idempotent and reliable
• Providers, resources, and data sources
• Simple workflow: init → plan → apply → destroy
