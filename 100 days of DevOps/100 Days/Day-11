🌊 Autoscaling vs Elastic Load Balancer – Explained with a Dam Analogy 💡

Imagine a dam that supplies water to a city 💧
	•	Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is like the main gate of the dam.
It distributes water evenly through different channels so that no single pipe bursts from too much pressure.
➤ In tech terms, ELB distributes incoming traffic to multiple servers to keep everything stable.
	•	Autoscaling is like the smart system that opens more gates when the city’s water demand increases — and closes them when demand goes down.
➤ In tech terms, Autoscaling automatically adds or removes servers based on traffic load.

Together, they make sure the system never overflows or runs dry — maintaining balance, performance, and reliability ⚙️
