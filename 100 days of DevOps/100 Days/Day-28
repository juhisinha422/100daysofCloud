100 Days of DevOps  — Day 28(28/100)

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
🔥 Stay consistent


1️⃣ Why do we use SonarQube?
SonarQube is used to automatically check code quality.
 It detects bugs, security issues, and bad coding practices early.

2️⃣ What are Bugs in SonarQube?
Bugs are coding errors that can cause the application to fail or behave wrongly.
 Example: null pointer exception, wrong logic, infinite loop.
3️⃣ What are Vulnerabilities?
Vulnerabilities are security weaknesses in the code.
 Attackers can exploit them to access data or damage the system.

4️⃣ What is Code Smell?
Code smell means poor-quality code that works but is hard to maintain.
 It increases technical debt and future bugs.

5️⃣ What is Code Duplication?
Code duplication means same code repeated in multiple places.
 It makes changes harder and increases the chance of errors.

6️⃣ What is Code Coverage?
Code coverage shows how much code is tested using automated tests.
 Higher coverage means better-tested and more reliable code.
7️⃣ What is Security Rating?
Security rating shows how secure the application code is.
 It is graded from A (best) to E (worst).

8️⃣ What is Maintainability Rating?
Maintainability rating shows how easy the code is to modify or fix.
 Clean and simple code gets a better rating.

9️⃣ What is Technical Debt?
Technical debt is extra work needed later due to poor coding now.
 More debt means more maintenance effort in the future.

🔟 What is Quality Gate?
Quality Gate is a set of conditions the code must pass.
 If it fails, build or deployment can be stopped.


============================


Bugs = Errors in code that cause wrong behavior or crashes

Vulnerabilities = Security weaknesses that attackers can exploit

Code Smell = Poor design that makes code hard to maintain

Code Duplication = Same logic written in multiple places

Code Coverage = Amount of code executed by automated tests

Security Rating = Indicator of how secure the application is

Maintainability Rating = Indicator of how easy the code is to modify

Technical Debt = Future effort caused by poor coding decisions

Quality Gate = Conditions that code must meet to be accepted

Static Code Analysis = Code inspection without running the program
