100 Days of DevOps  — Day 21 (21/100)

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
🔥 Stay consistent 


===========


1️⃣ What are .tfvars files in Terraform?

.tfvars files store variable values separately from the main Terraform configuration, allowing cleaner and reusable setups.
They help manage multiple environments like dev, test, and prod by providing different variable files.

⸻

2️⃣ When should you use a .auto.tfvars file?

Terraform automatically loads any file ending with .auto.tfvars without specifying it during execution.
This is useful when you want default variable sets to always apply for that environment.

⸻

3️⃣ What is a Terraform Workspace?

A Workspace allows you to manage multiple state files inside the same Terraform configuration.
It helps you separate environments like dev/stage/prod without duplicating code.

⸻

4️⃣ When do you use Workspace vs tfvars?

Workspaces separate state, while tfvars separate values.
Use Workspaces for environment isolation and tfvars for environment configuration.

⸻

5️⃣ What is a Repository in DevOps?

A repository is a storage location for your code, configurations, and version history.
It helps collaboration, tracking changes, and maintaining project integrity.

⸻

6️⃣ What is RBAC in Kubernetes?


Role-Based Access Control manages permissions in Kubernetes based on roles and bindings.
It ensures users, groups, and service accounts have only the required access.

⸻

7️⃣ What is the difference between Role and ClusterRole in Kubernetes RBAC?


A Role gives permissions within a specific namespace.
A ClusterRole gives permissions across the entire cluster.

⸻

8️⃣ What is the difference between RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding?


RoleBinding connects a Role to users or service accounts within a namespace.
ClusterRoleBinding connects a ClusterRole to users cluster-wide.

⸻

9️⃣ What is Kubernetes Administration?

Kubernetes administration includes cluster setup, node management, networking, storage, monitoring, and security controls.
Admins ensure clusters are scalable, secure, and always running.

⸻

🔟 What is the purpose of kubeconfig in administration?

The kubeconfig file stores cluster connection details like servers, certificates, and contexts.
It allows users and tools to authenticate and access Kubernetes clusters safely.


==========

1️⃣ tfvars = stores environmental variable values
2️⃣ auto.tfvars = loads automatically as default variables
3️⃣ Workspace = separates Terraform state per environment
4️⃣ Workspace vs tfvars = state separation vs value separation
5️⃣ Repository = code storage + version control
6️⃣ RBAC = permission management in Kubernetes
7️⃣ Role = namespace-level permissions
8️⃣ ClusterRole = cluster-level permissions
9️⃣ K8s Admin = manages cluster operations
🔟 kubeconfig = stores authentication + cluster access details
