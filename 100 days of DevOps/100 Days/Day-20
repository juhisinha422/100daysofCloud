100 Days of DevOps — Day 20(20/100)

1️⃣ What is OOMKilled?

A container is OOMKilled when it exceeds its memory limit.
The OS kills it to protect the node.

OOMKilled means Out Of Memory Killed.

⸻

2️⃣ What is the Kubernetes Scheduler?

The Scheduler decides which node a pod runs on.
It checks resource availability and scheduling rules.

⸻

3️⃣ What is a Node Selector?

Node Selector binds a pod to nodes using labels.
It’s the simplest scheduling constraint in Kubernetes.

⸻

4️⃣ What is a Taint?

A taint prevents pods from landing on a node.
Only pods with matching tolerations can run there.

⸻

5️⃣ What is a Toleration?

Tolerations allow pods to run on tainted nodes.
They don’t force scheduling but remove the block.

⸻

6️⃣ What is NoSchedule?

NoSchedule prevents pods from being scheduled on the node.
Only pods with matching tolerations can still run there.

⸻

7️⃣ What is NoExecute?

NoExecute blocks new pods and evicts existing ones.
Pods must have tolerations to stay or be scheduled.

⸻

8️⃣ What is PreferNoSchedule?

PreferNoSchedule is a soft block — scheduler tries to avoid the node.
Pods may still run if no better node is available.

⸻

9️⃣ What is Affinity?

Affinity sets rules to place pods on certain nodes.
It controls pod placement using required/preferred conditions.

⸻

🔟 What is Anti-Affinity?

Anti-affinity ensures pods do NOT run together on the same node.
It helps with high availability and spreading workloads.

🔥 Helm Concepts (Extra Revision Today)

🔸 Helm: Kubernetes package manager
🔸 Template: Dynamic YAML with placeholders ({{ }})
🔸 values.yaml: Central config file used to populate templates

What is values.yaml?

values.yaml holds the configuration values that fill into templates and make deployments reusable.


=============
1. OOMKilled = memory limit crossed.

1. Scheduler = selects best node.
2. Node Selector = match labels.
3. Taint = block pods.
4. Toleration = allow on tainted nodes.
5. NoSchedule = block scheduling.
6. NoExecute = block + evict.
7. PreferNoSchedule = soft avoid.
8. Affinity = group pods.
9. Anti-Affinity = spread pod

10. Helm = app packaging.
11. Template = dynamic YAML.
 • values.yaml = config input.
