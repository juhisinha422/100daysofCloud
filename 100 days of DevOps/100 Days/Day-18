100 Days of DevOps  — Day 18 (18/100)

💭 Small daily habits create big lifetime changes.
🔥 Stay consistent 


=======

1) What is EBS?

EBS (Elastic Block Store) is AWS block-level storage used for EC2 instances that behaves like a virtual hard disk. It provides persistent storage even after EC2 stops.

⸻

2) What is IAM?

IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the AWS service that controls user access and permissions for all AWS resources.

⸻

3) What is Reclaiming Policy in Kubernetes?


A reclaim policy defines what happens to the PV (PersistentVolume) when its PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim) is deleted.

⸻

4) What is the Retain Reclaim Policy?

Answer:
Retain keeps the actual storage disk even after the PVC is deleted; manual cleanup is required.

⸻

5) What is the Recycle Reclaim Policy?

Answer:
Recycle wipes the data (basic scrub) and makes the PV available again. (Note: Deprecated)

⸻

6) What is the Delete Reclaim Policy?

Answer:
Delete removes the PV and the underlying storage (EBS/EFS) automatically.

⸻

7) What is a Node Selector in Kubernetes?

A node selector is the simplest way to schedule a pod onto a specific node based on matching labels.

⸻

8) What is a StorageClass?

A StorageClass defines how dynamic storage should be provisioned automatically, such as EBS, EFS, or SSD types.

⸻

9) What is EFS?

EFS (Elastic File System) is a scalable, shared file system that multiple EC2 instances or pods can access at the same time.

⸻

10) What is the difference between EBS and EFS?

•	EBS: Block storage, attached to one EC2 at a time, high performance but not shared.

•	EFS: Shared file storage, can attach to many EC2s/pods at once, auto-scales.

=============

1.	EBS: Block storage for one EC2 instance.
	
2.	IAM: Permission and access control service in AWS.
	
3.	Reclaim Policy: Defines what happens to PV after PVC deletion.
	
4.	Retain: Keeps the disk for manual cleanup.
	
5.	Recycle: Cleans and reuses the PV.
	
6.	Delete: Deletes PV and its backend storage automatically.
	
7.	Node Selector: Schedules pods to nodes using labels.
	
8.	StorageClass: Handles dynamic provisioning of storage.
	
9.	EFS: Shared file system accessible by multiple instances.
	
10.	EBS vs EFS: EBS = single-attach block storage; EFS = multi-attach shared storage.
