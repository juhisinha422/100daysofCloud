Tight Coupling vs Loose Coupling in AWS (Child–Parent Example)

⚡ Tight Coupling
👶 A child depends on the parent for every action — if the parent isn’t there, the child is stuck.
👉 In AWS, this is like running App + Database inside one EC2 instance. If EC2 fails, both crash.

⚡ Loose Coupling
🧑🎓 A parent guides, but the child can act independently — even if the parent is away, the child still manages.
👉 In AWS, this is like separating services (App on EC2/ECS/Lambda, DB on RDS, storage on S3, communication via SQS/SNS).

📌 Definition
	•	🔗 Tight Coupling = Components are strongly dependent on each other.
	•	🔓 Loose Coupling = Components interact through minimal, well-defined connections, so one can change or fail without breaking the other.

🌍 Real-Time Example
	•	🚀 Loose Coupling: Amazon’s order processing → payment, inventory, and shipping services run independently but talk through queues/events.
	•	🏗️ Tight Coupling: Monolithic apps → billing, shipping, and inventory live in one block. If one fails, the whole system stops.

💡 Loose coupling = reliability, scalability
