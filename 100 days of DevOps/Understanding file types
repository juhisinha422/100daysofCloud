Planning a Trip = Understanding File Types

Ever wondered how .js, .json, .sh, or .conf files differ? Let’s connect it to something simple: planning a trip! ✈️

⸻

🔹 Instructions (Scripts / Programs)

These are like the travel plan you follow.
	•	.java / .py / .sh / .js
👉 Example: Your itinerary → “Wake up at 6 AM, pack bags, catch 8 AM train.”
They tell you step-by-step what to do.

⸻

🔹 Data (Information)

This is like the list of details you need for the trip.
	•	.json / .csv / .sql
👉 Example: Passenger list + hotel details → Name, tickets, dates.
It doesn’t tell you what to do — it just holds the facts.

⸻

🔹 Configuration (Settings)

These are the preferences & rules you set.
	•	.conf / .env / .yml / .ini
👉 Example: “Choose vegetarian meals, window seat, budget limit ₹20,000.”
They don’t do the trip, but they control how it runs.

⸻

🔹 Device / Technology (Where it runs)

This is the vehicle / platform that makes the trip possible.
👉 Example: Train, Bus, Flight, Car = The device/server/cloud where your instructions, data, and settings are applied.

✅ Quick Analogy Recap
	•	Scripts = Travel Itinerary (actions)
	•	Data = Passenger List & Bookings (information)
	•	Config = Preferences & Settings (rules)
	•	Device = Vehicle / Platform (where it happens)

	•	JavaScript → app.js
	•	JSON → data.json
	•	CSV → employees.csv
	•	SQL → create_table.sql
	•	Config → nginx.conf
