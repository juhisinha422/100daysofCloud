Search & Text Processing =Phone-Flow Recall
==============================

find /logs -name "*.log" | grep "ERROR" | awk '{print $1,$3}' | sed 's/old/new/g' | sort | uniq | wc -l

Find file → Search word → Pick fields → Edit text → Sort → Remove duplicates → Count

 User Management — ONE-LINE MEMORY FLOW
================================

whoami → id → useradd → usermod → passwd → groupadd
Who am I → Show ID → Hire → Update → Lock/Unlock → Create team

passwd — ONE DOOR STORY 
===================

passwd user → passwd -d → passwd -l → passwd -u → passwd -e
Add lock → Remove lock → Lock door → Unlock door → Force new lock

Process Management 
==============

ps → top → htop → kill → kill -9 → bg → fg → jobs
See workers → Watch live → Advanced view → Ask to stop → Throw out → Send aside → Bring back → Check tasks

Disk & Memory
==========

df -h → du -sh → free -m → lsblk → mount → umount
Check phone → Check folder → Check RAM → See drives → Plug SD → Unplug SD

df -h  → Check total disk/phone storage
du -sh  → Check size of a specific folder or app
free -m → Check remaining RAM
lsblk  → List all storage devices (internal + external)
mount  → Attach / mount a storage device
umount  → Safely detach / unmount a storage device

Networking (Communication)
====================

IP → Ping → Curl → Wget → SS → Netstat
Number → Call → Chat → Download → Check calls → Check signal

ip a  → Check my phone number/IP
ping  → Call friend / test connection
curl  → Chat with an API/app
wget  → Download files/media
ss   → See who is calling (open ports)
netstat → Check network health/status

DevOps / Interview Must-Know (Command Logic)
==================================

Pipe → Output flow | > overwrite → >> append | && success → || fail


ps aux | grep nginx ------------List all processes → only show nginx
echo "Hello" > file.txt----------Writes “Hello” into file.txt, replacing old content       
echo "New line" >> file.txt----Adds “New line” without removing old content
mkdir test && cd test---------Create directory → go inside only if creation   succeeded
mkdir test || echo "Directory exists"--Try to create → if fails, show message
